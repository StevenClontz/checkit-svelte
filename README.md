# CheckIt Viewer

A single-page Svelte/TypeScript application available at <https://checkit.clontz.org>. This app reads
JSON "banks" generated by <https://github.com/stevenclontz/checkit/> and provides an elegant interface
for students to practice these exercises, and for instructors to generate LaTeX/PDF quizzes using
these exercises.

## Iframe-embeddable code cell

A simplified code cell powered by [SageMathCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) is available at its own
page at <https://checkit.clontz.org/codecell/#python>. By changing the hash value to any supported language
(e.g. <https://checkit.clontz.org/codecell/#r>) you can specify the default language selected when loading the
page, but users can always choose their language of choice.

The main application is to allow developers to simply embed a code cell by using an Iframe
(in particular, this can be used in situations where arbitrary Javascript is unallowed, e.g. LMSes):

```
<iframe id="iframeCodeCell"
    title="Iframe Code Cell"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    src="https://checkit.clontz.org/codecell/#sage">
</iframe>
```

# svelte app (original template README)

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Using TypeScript

This template comes with a script to set up a TypeScript development environment, you can run it immediately after cloning the template with:

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

Or remove the script via:

```bash
rm scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
vercel deploy --name my-project
```

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
